                outline in this Privacy Policy. This policy does not apply to the practices of&nbsp;&nbsp;

                that Phonezoo does not employ or manage.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phonezoo collects&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                non-personally&nbsp;&nbsp; identifiable information when you visit our website (www.phonezoo.com).&nbsp;
                This data includes your IP address, the IP address and URL of the Website that sent
                you to the Phonezoo main page, browser cookie and browser type.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                This data is automatically recorded in our server logs and is used to manage the
                website, track usage and improve the Phonezoo website&nbsp; and&nbsp; services.
                When you use Phonezoo services and register for Phonezoo, we collect additional
                information such as your name, mobile phone number, mobile&nbsp;&nbsp; phone device
                information and network carrier information. We also collect any optional information
                you choose to enter like email address,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; location information (such
                as address,&nbsp; zip&nbsp; code,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and country), gender and age.When
                you connect to the Phonezoo services on your mobile device, if your mobile phone
                service provider uniquely identifies the device, Phonezoo will&nbsp; receive&nbsp;
                this&nbsp; information.&nbsp; Phonezoo may use your unique mobile device identification&nbsp;
                information to&nbsp;&nbsp; offer you&nbsp;&nbsp; extended services and/or functionality.
                Some mobile phone&nbsp; service&nbsp; providers&nbsp; are required&nbsp; to operate
                a system&nbsp; that&nbsp; will&nbsp; record the physical location of devices that
                use their service.</p>
            Depending on the mobile phone service provider,&nbsp; Phonezoo may&nbsp; automatically&nbsp;
            receive&nbsp; this&nbsp; information. When&nbsp; you&nbsp; visit&nbsp; the&nbsp;
            Phonezoo&nbsp; site,&nbsp; we&nbsp; may&nbsp; send&nbsp; one or more cookies to
            your computer that uniquely identifies your browser.&nbsp;&nbsp; Phonezoo uses both
            session cookies - cookies that expire after you close your browser - and persistent
            cookies - cookies that can be used by your browser&nbsp; on&nbsp; subsequent&nbsp;
            visits&nbsp; to&nbsp; the&nbsp; site.&nbsp; Some&nbsp; of&nbsp; our&nbsp; business&nbsp;
            partners&nbsp; may&nbsp; use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers).
            However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.&nbsp; The "help"&nbsp;
            portion of&nbsp; the toolbar&nbsp; on the majority of browsers will direct you on
            how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser
            to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We strongly
            recommend that you&nbsp; leave the&nbsp; cookies&nbsp; activated,&nbsp; however,
            because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Phonezoo's most&nbsp; attractive
            features.&nbsp; Phonezoo members can invite friends to join the service and preview
            content by&nbsp; sending&nbsp; invitation&nbsp; emails&nbsp; via&nbsp; our&nbsp;
            automated&nbsp; invitation&nbsp; system.&nbsp; Phonezoo&nbsp; stores&nbsp; the email
            addresses that members provide so that the respondents may be added as Friends of
            the member sending the invitations, and also to send reminders of the invitations.&nbsp;
            Phonezoo&nbsp; does&nbsp; not&nbsp; sell&nbsp; these email addresses or use them
            to send any other communication&nbsp; besides&nbsp; invitations,&nbsp; invitation&nbsp;
